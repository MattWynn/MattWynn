- 👋 Hi, I’m @MattWynn
- 👀 I’m interested in geometry, snowboarding, and spiritual alchemy.
- 🌱 I work for Moore Nanotechnology Systems (Nanotech) using C# for computer aided manufacturing (CAM).  I'm very experienced in C++ and Fortran.  A little bit of experience in Python, Java, etc., etc.
- 💞️ I had been looking to collaborate on the Autodesk Fusion ecosystem, but right now I'm focused on Nanotech and several non-computer topics.
- 📫 How to reach me: I occasionally read email sent to shralpstickers@gmail.com
